### Section 1: Introduction of Nick Carraway

#### Subsection 1.1: Nick’s Background and Family
**(Opening to "I graduated from Stanford in 2015...")**

- **Opening Line and Father’s Advice**:
  - "In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. 'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.'"
  - This advice establishes Nick as a character who strives to be non-judgmental and suggests that he has had certain advantages in life.

- **Nick’s Family Background**:
  - Nick comes from a prominent family in the Midwest, wealthy for three generations.
  - His family owns a chain of successful real estate businesses, providing him with a comfortable upbringing.
  - This background sets up Nick’s social status and the expectations placed upon him.

#### Subsection 1.2: Nick’s Move to Miami
**("In consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgments...")**

- **Nick’s Non-Judgmental Philosophy**:
  - Nick’s father's advice has led him to adopt a philosophy of reserving judgment, making him a tolerant and observant narrator.
  - He explains that this trait sometimes causes people to confide in him, sharing their secrets and revealing their true selves.

- **Education and Career Aspirations**:
  - Nick graduated from Stanford in 2015, highlighting his privileged background and high level of education.
  - After graduation, he worked in Silicon Valley but found the tech world unfulfilling.
  - Seeking a fresh start and hoping to capitalize on Miami’s booming real estate market, Nick decides to move to Miami to work in the real estate investment business.

- **Introduction to West Miami**:
  - Nick explains his decision to move to West Miami, a less fashionable but rapidly developing area.
  - West Miami is characterized by new wealth and vibrant development, in contrast to the more established and exclusive neighborhoods of Coral Gables and Coconut Grove.
  - This sets the stage for the social dynamics and class distinctions that will be explored throughout the novel.

#### Subsection 1.3: Reflections on the East and the West
**("And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of tropical greenery...")**

- **Cultural and Moral Contrasts**:
  - Nick reflects on his return from the East Coast, hinting that the experiences he is about to recount have changed him significantly.
  - He contrasts the moral and cultural values of the East Coast with those of the Midwest, suggesting that the East Coast, and now Miami, are more corrupt and decadent.
  - This reflection foreshadows the novel’s exploration of the moral decay hidden beneath the surface of wealth and glamour.

- **Sense of Nostalgia**:
  - Nick’s nostalgia for the Midwest is evident as he describes the region’s stability and moral integrity.
  - This sets up a recurring theme in the novel: the tension between the allure of the glamorous, yet morally ambiguous, Miami and the wholesome, yet stifling, Midwest.
