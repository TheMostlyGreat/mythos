# Writing Style

### Narrative Voice, Tone, and Style

- **Narrative Voice:** 
  This refers to the personality of the narrator and how they present the story. Is the narrator first-person, third-person omniscient, or limited? For example, a first-person narrative might feel more personal and intimate, while a third-person omniscient narrative might provide a broader, more objective view.

- **Inspiration:** Lists of inspirational texts, quotes, or other written works.

- **Tone and Mood:** 
  Tone is the author's attitude toward the subject, while mood is the feeling evoked in the reader. The tone could be serious, humorous, sarcastic, etc., and the mood might be suspenseful, melancholic, or joyful.

### Lexical Analysis

- **Word Choice (Lexicon):**
  This is about the selection of words that fit your narrative voice and tone. It involves choosing vocabulary that reflects the setting, era, and characters.

### Syntax and Rhythm

- **Sentence Structure (Syntax):** 
  This involves the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences. Consider whether you'll use long, complex sentences or short, simple ones, and how this affects the story's rhythm and pace.

### Literary Devices

- **Figurative Language:**
  This includes metaphors, similes, personification, and other devices that add depth and creativity to your writing.

### Discourse Analysis

- **Narrative Voice and Point of View:** 
  Here you define how the narrative voice aligns with the point of view (POV). Is it consistent? Does it reflect the character's perspective and understanding?

### Pragmatic Analysis

- **Context and Meaning (Pragmatics):**
  This involves understanding the context in which your story takes place and ensuring the dialogue and actions of characters make sense within this context.

### Structure and Form

- **Text Structure:** 
  This is about the overall organization of your novel, including chapters, scenes, and pacing. How will the story unfold?


### Consistency

- **Guidelines and Reviews:** 
  Establish rules for your writing style and regularly review your work to ensure consistency. This might include a style guide or regular edits to maintain voice, tone, and syntax.

# EXAMPLE: Writing Style for "The Road" by Cormac McCarthy

### Narrative Voice, Tone, and Style

- **Narrative Voice:** 
  "The Road" uses a third-person limited narrative voice that closely follows the father and son's experiences.

  *Example:* "When he woke in the woods in the dark and the cold of the night he'd reach out to touch the child sleeping beside him."

- **Tone and Mood:** 
  The tone is bleak and somber, contributing to a mood of desolation and occasional tenderness.

  *Example:* "Barren, silent, godless. They crossed the river by the bridge and walked out along the dry asphalt road."

### Lexical Analysis

- **Word Choice (Lexicon):**
  McCarthy's language is sparse and direct, often poetic in its simplicity.

  *Example:* "He walked out in the gray light and stood and he saw for a brief moment the absolute truth of the world. The cold relentless circling of the intestate earth."

### Syntax and Rhythm

- **Sentence Structure (Syntax):** 
  McCarthy uses varied sentence structures, with short, fragmented sentences for urgency and longer sentences for description.

  *Example:* "He said: If he is not the word of God God never spoke."

### Literary Devices

- **Figurative Language:**
  McCarthy employs metaphors and similes with a stark quality.

  *Example:* "Dark of the invisible moon. The nights now only slightly less black. By day the dead sun circles in a faltering sky."

### Discourse Analysis

- **Narrative Voice and Point of View:** 
  The narrative voice is consistent with the third-person limited POV, closely following the father's perspective.

  *Example:* "He knew only that the child was his warrant. He said: If he is not the word of God God never spoke."

### Pragmatic Analysis

- **Context and Meaning (Pragmatics):**
  The dialogue and narrative reflect the harsh, survivalist context, with minimalistic dialogue that implies more than it states.

  *Example:* 
  ``` 
  "Are you okay?"
  "Yes."
  "Okay."
  ```

### Structure and Form

- **Text Structure:** 
  "The Road" follows a linear structure with episodic scenes, often separated by breaks in the text.

  *Example:* "They passed through the city at noon of the day following. He kept the boy close to his side. The city was mostly burned. No sign of life."

### Consistency

- **Guidelines and Reviews:** 
  McCarthy maintains a consistent voice, tone, and style throughout the novel.

  *Example:* "He pushed the cart and both he and the child wore masks cut from old bedslips. Tied at the corners. Blue plastic trolling masks of a lost sun."
