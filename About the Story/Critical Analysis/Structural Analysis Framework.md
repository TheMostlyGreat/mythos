**What is a Structural Analysis?** Structural analysis examines a text's internal elements such as narrative patterns, character roles, and language use. It focuses on how these components interact to create meaning, rather than considering external factors like the author’s biography or historical context. This method reveals how the text is constructed and shapes the reader's experience.
