# Define Behavior & Scenario Gate

## Define Behavior

**Entry:** Agent enters `define-behavior` phase (after discovery or resume).

### Iron Law

**DERIVE DIMENSIONS BEFORE WRITING SCENARIOS** — systematic coverage, not intuition.

### Pipeline (5 steps)

1. **Derive dimensions** from intake artifacts (resolved questions, done-when, scope) + domain-knowledge dimensions not surfaced during intake
2. **Partition** each dimension into equivalence classes + boundary values
3. **Generate scenarios** — one per partition + boundary cases. Each scenario proves a specific **Acceptance Criterion** from intake (`spec.md`); if a scenario doesn't map to any AC, either it's testing implementation (drop it) or an AC is missing (go back and add it).
4. **Organize under rules** with card-ratio self-check (too many rules? any rules with no examples? open questions?). Rules group scenarios by the AC they prove, so every AC has ≥1 scenario and no scenario is an orphan.
5. **Present to user** (decider) — user accepts, tweaks, or adds

Save the dimension table to `dimensions.md` in the ticket folder before writing test-definitions.md (the pre-tool hook enforces this for features). For tiny features with one obvious behavioral dimension and no partitioning to enumerate, dimensions.md may instead be a single line `skip: <non-empty reason>`.

### Scenario saturation

Each propose-and-converge turn either surfaces new scenarios or doesn't. When a turn produces no new scenarios → proceed to scenario-gate.

### Concrete example

**Context:** User asked for `--dry-run` on init. Intake produced scope (show what would be created without creating), done-when (output matches real init, no side effects).

**Agent turn 1:**

> From intake I see 2 behavioral dimensions:
>
> | Dimension              | Partitions                                    |
> | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
> | Output correctness     | empty dir, existing config, conflicting files |
> | Side-effect prevention | filesystem writes, git operations             |
>
> Organized under 3 rules:
>
> **Rule: Dry-run output matches real init**
>
> - [ ] Shows expected files in empty directory
> - [ ] Shows warning when config already exists
> - [ ] Shows conflict notice for incompatible existing files
>
> **Rule: Dry-run creates no files**
>
> - [ ] No files created on disk
>
> **Rule: Dry-run skips git operations**
>
> - [ ] No git init or git add executed
>
> 3 rules, 5 scenarios, 0 open questions. The "conflicting files" partition came from domain knowledge — init currently overwrites without warning, so dry-run should surface that. Anything missing, or ready for the quality gate?

**User:** "Looks good, proceed."

**Result:** No new scenarios → scenario saturation → proceed to scenario-gate.

### Two formats: discovery vs saved

**Discovery shorthand** (in chat, presenting to user): Rule + bare scenario checkboxes — fast to read, easy to amend in conversation. This is what turn-1 above looks like.

**Saved format** (`test-definitions.md` on disk): nested `## Rule:` / `### Scenario:` with Given/When/Then + per-scenario `- [ ] RED / GREEN / REFACTOR` sub-checkboxes. The R/G/R sub-checkboxes are load-bearing — the prompt hook parses them to inject TDD-step guidance during implement, and they enforce one-commit-per-step discipline. Keep scenarios declarative (what, not how) and aim for 3-5 G/W/T steps per scenario.

```markdown
## Rule: Description of business rule

### Scenario: Partition A

Given [context]
When [action]
Then [outcome]

- [ ] RED
- [ ] GREEN
- [ ] REFACTOR

### Scenario: Partition B (boundary)

Given [context]
When [action]
Then [outcome]

- [ ] RED
- [ ] GREEN
- [ ] REFACTOR

## Rule: Non-obvious rule

> Rationale: Why this rule exists and why these partitions matter

### Scenario: Partition C

Given [context]
When [action]
Then [outcome]

- [ ] RED
- [ ] GREEN
- [ ] REFACTOR
```

### Scenario naming: lineage scheme

Each saved `### Scenario:` title carries the acceptance criterion it proves, so the
link back to AC, JTBD, and persona is machine-checkable rather than eyeballed:

`<jtbd-id>.AC<#>.<scenario_name>` — `scenario_name` is snake_case; the rest is the
AC id from intake (`<slug>.<persona-code><JTBD#>.AC<#>`). Long ids are fine — no
truncation.

Worked example — feature `oauth-flow`, persona Platform Operator (PO), first JTBD:

| Layer    | Id                                                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| JTBD     | `oauth-flow.PO1`                                                   |
| AC       | `oauth-flow.PO1.AC2`                                               |
| Scenario | `oauth-flow.PO1.AC2.change_association_applies_to_subsequent_auth` |

```text
### Scenario: oauth-flow.PO1.AC2.change_association_applies_to_subsequent_auth
```

A free-text title (no `<jtbd-id>.AC<#>` prefix) is left alone — it simply proves no
AC. `safeword check` reads the scheme and reports coverage gaps for in-progress
tickets as advisories (never a gate):

- **uncovered** — an AC in `spec.md` that no scenario references.
- **stale ref** — a scenario whose JTBD exists but whose `AC<#>` does not (a typo,
  or an AC that was renumbered).
- **orphan** — a scenario whose JTBD is absent from `spec.md` entirely.

### Define Behavior Exit (REQUIRED)

1. **Save scenarios** to `.safeword-project/tickets/{id}-{slug}/test-definitions.md`
2. **Update frontmatter:** `phase: scenario-gate`
3. **Add work log entry:**

   ```
   - {timestamp} Complete: define-behavior - {N} scenarios defined across {M} rules
   ```

## Scenario Quality Gate

**Entry:** Agent enters `scenario-gate` phase.

### AODI Validation

Validate each scenario against four criteria:

| Criterion         | Check                          | Red flag                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **Atomic**        | Tests ONE behavior             | Multiple When/Then pairs        |
| **Observable**    | Has externally visible outcome | Internal state only             |
| **Deterministic** | Same result on repeated runs   | Time/random/external dependency |
| **Independent**   | No ordering dependency         | "After Scenario 2 runs..."      |

### Adversarial pass

After AODI validation, argue against your own scenario list: "What breaks that none of these scenarios catch?" Present any findings to the user.

### Coverage saturation

If the adversarial pass + user feedback produced new scenarios → loop back to define-behavior. If nothing new surfaced → done.

### Scenario Gate Exit (REQUIRED)

1. Each scenario validated (Atomic, Observable, Deterministic, Independent)
2. Adversarial pass complete — issues reported or confirmed clean
3. **Assign test layers + sequence the work** — for each scenario pick the highest test layer that covers it with acceptable feedback speed (unit < integration < E2E), and order tasks so each builds on what's already green. For non-obvious slicing or data-model choices, run `/figure-it-out`; the architecture itself was already designed in intake. (Absorbed from the retired `decomposition` phase — see the ADR in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.)
4. **Update frontmatter:** `phase: implement`
5. **Add work log entry:**

   ```
   - {timestamp} Complete: scenario-gate - Scenarios validated (AODI) + adversarial pass; test layers + build order assigned
   ```
