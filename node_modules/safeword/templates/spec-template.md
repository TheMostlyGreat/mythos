# Spec: {title}

<!--
Product-framing spec for a feature ticket. The engineering contract
(scope / out_of_scope / done_when) lives in ticket.md frontmatter; this
file holds the *why and who*. The bdd intake flow authors it before
engineering scope. Fill each section, then delete the
guidance comments.
-->

## Intent

<!-- One or two sentences: what this feature is for and why it matters.
This is the single source of truth for motivation — ticket.md drops its
**Why:** line and points here. -->

## References

<!-- Related tickets, prior art, designs, external docs. Optional. -->

## Personas

<!-- The personas this feature serves, referenced by name or code from
.safeword-project/personas.md (e.g., Platform Operator (PO)). Add new
personas to that file — don't invent them here. -->

## Vocabulary

<!-- Domain terms specific to this feature, consistent with
.safeword-project/glossary.md. Optional. -->

## Jobs To Be Done

<!--
One persona per JTBD, in the form "When I …, I want …, so I can …". If two
personas share a motivation, write two JTBDs. The heading id is
<slug>.<persona-code><n> (e.g., oauth-flow.PO1). Add as many as the
feature needs. If there is genuinely no persona-facing job (internal
plumbing), write `skip: <reason>` here instead.

Uncomment and customize:

### oauth-flow.PO1 — Rotate credentials without a flag day

**Persona:** Platform Operator (PO)

> When I rotate a server's API key, I want the previous key to keep working
> for a short grace period, so I can roll the change across my fleet without
> coordinated downtime.

Acceptance Criteria — one capability or guarantee per AC, id <jtbd-id>.AC<n>,
in descriptive product language (a guarantee the user can observe), NOT
implementation ("returns 204" belongs in a scenario's Then). Each define-behavior
scenario will prove a specific AC. If a JTBD has no user-observable capability
to enumerate, write `skip: <reason>` under it instead of ACs.

#### oauth-flow.PO1.AC1 — The previous key keeps authenticating for a bounded grace window

#### oauth-flow.PO1.AC2 — The operator can see which keys are currently live
-->

## Outcomes

<!-- Observable results that tell us the JTBDs are satisfied — the product
counterpart to ticket.md's done_when. -->

## Open Questions

<!-- Unresolved questions surfaced during intake — the spec's running list of
what we don't know yet (the equivalent of Example Mapping's red "question"
cards). Add one per line as they come up; before advancing to define-behavior,
resolve each (answer it, then delete the line) or record `defer: <reason>` for
a deliberate punt. A long unresolved list means intake isn't done — keep
converging. Delete this comment when you add real questions. -->
