# Audit

Run a comprehensive code audit. Execute checks and report results by severity.

## Invocation log

This skill is required at the done-gate (ticket 147). The line below appends a session-scoped entry to `.safeword-project/skill-invocations.log` so the done-gate hook can verify /audit was actually invoked. Bash injection runs at render time — hand-writing audit results cannot produce this entry.

!`PROJECT_DIR="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)}" && mkdir -p "$PROJECT_DIR/.safeword-project" && echo "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ) ${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID} audit" >> "$PROJECT_DIR/.safeword-project/skill-invocations.log" && echo "[skill-invocation-log] audit ✓" || echo "[skill-invocation-log] FAILED — done-gate will block"`

**If you see `[skill-invocation-log] FAILED` above, or no `audit ✓` line at all**: STOP. Do not run /audit manually — that line is the only proof the done-gate accepts. Report the failure to the user (most likely cause: Claude Code's bash permission denied the injection) and ask them to resolve it before re-invoking /audit.

## Instructions

### 1. Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Ensure we're in the project root regardless of prior CWD state
cd "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2> /dev/null || pwd)}" || exit 1

# =========================================================================
# DETECT CONFIG DRIFT (read-only — no writes)
# =========================================================================

# 0. Compare generated vs on-disk depcruise config. Non-zero exit = drift.
#    /audit must never mutate the working tree; surface stale config as W007.
bunx safeword@latest sync-config --check 2>&1 || echo "[W007] Stale .safeword/depcruise-config.cjs — run \`safeword sync-config\` to refresh and commit"

# =========================================================================
# ARCHITECTURE CHECKS (circular deps, layer violations)
# =========================================================================

# 1a. Architecture - TypeScript/JS (depcruise)
DEPCRUISE_CONFIG=""
[ -f .dependency-cruiser.cjs ] && DEPCRUISE_CONFIG=".dependency-cruiser.cjs"
[ -f .dependency-cruiser.js ] && DEPCRUISE_CONFIG=".dependency-cruiser.js"
[ -n "$DEPCRUISE_CONFIG" ] && {
  bunx depcruise --output-type err --config "$DEPCRUISE_CONFIG" . 2>&1 || true
}

# 1b. Architecture - Python
# Note: Python circular imports cause ImportError at runtime.
# If your Python code runs, it has no blocking circular imports.
# For static analysis, consider: pip install import-linter

# 1c. Architecture - Go
# Note: Go compiler prevents circular imports between packages at build time.
# If your Go project builds, it has no circular dependencies.

# =========================================================================
# DEAD CODE DETECTION
# =========================================================================

# 2a. Dead code - TypeScript/JS (knip with auto-fix + config hints)
[ -f package.json ] && {
  bunx knip --fix 2>&1 || true
  # Capture config hints separately for W005 detection
  bunx knip --reporter json 2> /dev/null || true
}

# 2b. Dead code - Python (deadcode)
([ -f pyproject.toml ] || [ -f requirements.txt ]) && {
  deadcode . 2>&1 || true
}

# 2c. Dead code - Go (golangci-lint unused)
[ -f go.mod ] && {
  golangci-lint run --enable unused --out-format colored-line-number 2>&1 || true
}

# =========================================================================
# CODE DUPLICATION
# =========================================================================

# 3. Copy/paste detection (all languages)
bunx jscpd . --gitignore --min-lines 10 --reporters console 2>&1 || true

# =========================================================================
# OUTDATED DEPENDENCIES
# =========================================================================

# 4a. Outdated - TypeScript/JS
[ -f package.json ] && {
  bun outdated 2>&1 || npm outdated 2>&1 || true
}

# 4b. Outdated - Python (uv > poetry > pip)
([ -f pyproject.toml ] || [ -f requirements.txt ]) && {
  uv pip list --outdated 2>&1 || poetry show --outdated 2>&1 || pip list --outdated 2>&1 || true
}

# 4c. Outdated - Go
[ -f go.mod ] && {
  go list -m -u all 2>&1 | grep '\[' || echo "All Go modules up to date"
}
```

#### Outdated Package Triage

After running the outdated checks above, **classify each outdated package** using this matrix:

| Dep Type | Bump      | Risk   | Action                                                 |
| -------- | --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| dev      | patch     | Low    | Safe to update now                                     |
| dev      | minor     | Low    | Safe to update now                                     |
| prod     | patch     | Low    | Safe to update — run tests after                       |
| prod     | minor     | Medium | Review changelog, then update                          |
| dev      | major     | Medium | Research breaking changes, may need config updates     |
| prod     | major     | High   | Defer to dedicated task — investigate migration path   |
| any      | 0.x minor | Medium | Treat as major (semver allows breaking changes in 0.x) |

Present results as a structured table:

```text
| Package | Current | Latest | Type | Bump | Risk |
|---------|---------|--------|------|------|------|
| knip | 5.86.0 | 5.88.1 | dev | patch | Low |
| eslint | 9.39.4 | 10.0.3 | dev | major | High |
```

Then give a **verdict per risk tier**:

- **Low risk:** "Safe to update now — dev-only tools, patch/minor bumps"
- **Medium risk:** "Review changelogs before updating" (list specific packages)
- **High risk:** "Defer to dedicated task — major version bumps need migration research" (list specific packages)

If all packages are up to date, report: `✅ All packages up to date`

#### Knip Configuration Hints (W005)

Check the `bunx knip --fix` output above for "Configuration hints" lines. Hints appear in the default reporter output, NOT in the `--reporter json` output. If knip reports **configuration hints** (unused entries in `ignoreDependencies`, `ignoreBinaries`, `ignoreUnresolved`, or `ignoreWorkspaces`), flag each as:

```text
- [W005] Stale config: `knip.json` — `{entry}` can be removed from {list}
```

These mean the ignore override no longer matches anything knip would flag — the suppression is dead config. Cleaning them up reduces noise for future readers.

If no configuration hints are found, skip this section.

### 2. Agent Config Checks

Find and check all agent configuration files (excluding `.safeword/`):

**Files to check:**

- `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` (root and subdirectories)
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (root and subdirectories)
- `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` or `.cursor/rules/*/` (root and subdirectories)
- `.cursorrules` (legacy)

**For each config file, check:**

| Check      | Criteria                                                            | Severity |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Size limit | CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md: ~150-200 instructions; Cursor rules: 500 lines | warn     |
| Structure  | Has WHAT/WHY/HOW sections                                           | warn     |
| Dead refs  | All referenced files/paths exist (skip URLs starting with http)     | error    |
| Staleness  | Last modified 30+ days ago AND commits exist since                  | warn     |

**Research sources:**

- [Anthropic Engineering](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices)
- [Cursor Docs](https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules)

### 3. Learning Files Check

Project learnings in `.safeword-project/learnings/*.md` must have a `Covers:` line on line 3 — the auto-generated `INDEX.md` is built from these lines, and files without them don't appear in the index.

```bash
if [ -d .safeword-project/learnings ]; then
  for f in .safeword-project/learnings/*.md; do
    [ -e "$f" ] || continue
    [ "$(basename "$f")" = "INDEX.md" ] && continue
    line3=$(sed -n '3p' "$f")
    case "$line3" in
      Covers:*) ;;
      *) echo "[W006] Missing Covers: line on line 3 — $f" ;;
    esac
  done
fi
```

Flag each non-conforming file as:

```text
- [W006] Learning file missing Covers: — `{path}` (absent from INDEX.md)
```

If all files conform, skip this section.

### 4. Test Quality Review

Review existing test files for quality issues. Sample test files from the project and check against the iron laws and anti-patterns in `.claude/skills/testing/SKILL.md`.

**Find test files:**

```bash
# Find test files (common patterns)
find . -name "*.test.*" -o -name "*.spec.*" -o -name "*_test.*" | grep -v node_modules | grep -v dist | head -20
```

**For each sampled test file, check:**

| Check                        | Criteria                                                                                                | Severity |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Meaningful assertions        | Every test has specific value/behavior assertions (not just `toBeTruthy`, `toBeDefined`, `not.toThrow`) | error    |
| Behavior over implementation | Tests assert observable outcomes, not internal state or mock call args                                  | warn     |
| Independence                 | No test depends on another test's side effects; fresh state per test                                    | error    |
| No arbitrary timeouts        | No `sleep()`, `waitForTimeout()`, or hardcoded delays                                                   | warn     |
| Edge case coverage           | Tests include error paths and boundary cases, not just happy path                                       | warn     |
| No duplicate tests           | Similar tests use parameterized/table-driven patterns (`it.each`)                                       | warn     |
| Test naming                  | Names describe behavior, not implementation ("returns 401 when..." not "works correctly")               | warn     |

**Report format:**

```text
Test Quality:
- Files reviewed: N
- Issues found: N (E errors, W warnings)
- [E/W] file.test.ts:42 — Weak assertion: `expect(result).toBeTruthy()` → assert specific value
- [E/W] file.test.ts:15 — Shared mutable state: `user` modified across tests
- [W] file.test.ts — Happy-path only: no error case tests for `processOrder()`
```

### 5. Project Documentation Checks

**ARCHITECTURE.md:**

- If missing → create from `.safeword/templates/architecture-template.md`
- If exists → check for drift and gaps:
  - **Drift (error):** Documented tech contradicts code (e.g., doc says "Redux", package.json has "zustand")
  - **Gap (warn):** Major dependencies not documented

**README.md:**

- Check staleness (last modified vs recent commits)

**Docs site (if exists):**

- Detect `docs/`, `documentation/` with Starlight/Docusaurus/etc config
- Check staleness of docs content

**Documentation impact check:**

Review recent commits (since last tag or last 20 commits). For each significantly changed area, check if related docs, readmes, or guides across the project need updating. Flag any documentation that references changed code but hasn't been updated.

## Report Format

Report findings by severity with codes:

### Errors (must fix)

- [E001] Dead ref: `CLAUDE.md` references missing file `src/foo.ts`
- [E002] Drift: `ARCHITECTURE.md` documents Redux, code uses Zustand

### Warnings (should review)

- [W001] Size: `CLAUDE.md` has 245 instructions (recommended: 150-200)
- [W002] Structure: `AGENTS.md` missing recommended WHAT/WHY/HOW sections
- [W003] Staleness: `README.md` last modified 45 days ago (12 commits since)
- [W004] Gap: `@tanstack/query` not documented in ARCHITECTURE.md
- [W005] Stale config: `knip.json` — `lodash` can be removed from ignoreDependencies
- [W006] Learning file missing Covers: — `.safeword-project/learnings/foo.md` (absent from INDEX.md)
- [W007] Stale .safeword/depcruise-config.cjs — run `safeword sync-config` to refresh and commit

### Code Quality

**Architecture:**

- Circular dependencies: [None / show cycle path]
- Layer violations: [None / show invalid import]

**Dead Code:**

- Fixed by knip: [list of auto-fixed items]

**Duplication:**

- Clone count: X (Y% of codebase)

**Outdated Packages:**

| Package | Current | Latest | Type | Bump | Risk |
| ------- | ------- | ------ | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| ...     | ...     | ...    | ...  | ...  | ...  |

(or `✅ All packages up to date` if none outdated)

**Verdict:**

- ✅ **Low risk (N):** Safe to update now — [summary]
- ⚠️ **Medium risk (N):** Review changelogs — [list packages]
- 🔴 **High risk (N):** Defer to dedicated task — [list packages]

**Test Quality:**

- Files reviewed: N
- Issues: [None / list by severity]

---

### Summary

```
Errors: N | Warnings: N | Passed: N

[Audit passed | Audit passed with warnings | Audit failed]

**Next:** [imperative — which fix to start, which package to upgrade, which file to update].
```

The `**Next:**` line is required, even on a clean pass. Name the immediate move (commit, mark ticket done, open a follow-up ticket for the warnings). A verdict without a concrete next action is incomplete — don't leave the user to guess which finding to address first.

**Voice:** plainspoken and concise — write to be scanned.
