# BDD Orchestrator

Behavior-first development for features. Discovery → Scenarios → Implementation.

**Iron Law:** DEFINE BEHAVIOR BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION

## Phase Tracking

Features progress through phases. Track in ticket frontmatter:

```yaml
---
type: feature
phase: implement # intake | define-behavior | scenario-gate | implement | verify | done
---
```

**Phase meanings:**

| Phase             | What happens                    | Details      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `intake`          | Context check, discovery        | DISCOVERY.md |
| `define-behavior` | Writing Given/When/Then         | SCENARIOS.md |
| `scenario-gate`   | Validating scenarios            | SCENARIOS.md |
| `implement`       | Outside-in TDD                  | TDD.md       |
| `verify`          | Evidence gate: /verify + /audit | VERIFY.md    |
| `done`            | Close ticket                    | DONE.md      |

**Update phase when:**

- Completing a BDD phase → set next phase
- Scenario-gate complete → set `implement` (test-layer + sequencing happens at the scenario-gate exit)
- Handing off to TDD → set `implement`
- All scenarios pass → set `verify`
- /verify + /audit complete (verify.md exists) → set `done`

### Phase-exit review (Tier 2)

Leaving a phase is gated on an **independent** review of that phase's work — not
your own pass. (Your own inline pass is Tier 1: `/self-review`, per asset, as you
author.) The phase exit is reviewed by a _fresh reviewer with no conversation
history_ so the author can't grade their own work: run it in a forked subagent —
a skill with `context: fork`, or an explicit subagent — hand it only the phase's
artifacts and the ticket's scope, and let **its** verdict decide. On a pass,
record the stamp that unblocks the advance:

```bash
bun .safeword/hooks/write-review-stamp.ts --phase <phase you are leaving>
```

If the reviewer finds blocking issues, fix them and re-review — don't stamp. To
skip a trivial or docs-only phase, append a reason
(`… --phase <phase> "<why no independent review is needed>"`). The phase-advance
gate enforces this when the review gate is enabled, and is inert otherwise.

## Resume Logic

When user references a ticket, resume work:

1. **Read ticket** → get current `phase:`
2. **Find progress** → first unchecked `[ ]` in test-definitions
3. **Check context** → read last work log entry
4. **Announce resume** → "Resuming at [phase]. Last: [log entry]."

**Resume by phase:**

| Phase             | Resume action                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `intake`          | Start understanding (propose-and-converge) |
| `define-behavior` | Continue drafting scenarios                |
| `scenario-gate`   | Continue validating scenarios              |
| `implement`       | Find first unchecked scenario, run TDD     |
| `verify`          | Run /verify and /audit, write verify.md    |
| `done`            | Close ticket (verify.md must exist)        |

---

## Current Behavior

1. Understand first (see SAFEWORD.md "Understanding") — propose-and-converge until user accepts proposal with structured scope
2. Size internally (see SAFEWORD.md "Sizing") — state scope assessment in proposal, not as a separate announcement
3. **If user references iteration/story/phase from a spec:**
   - Check if child ticket exists for that iteration
   - If not → create ticket, run full BDD
   - If yes → resume at current phase
4. **If ticket exists:** Read phase, resume at appropriate point
5. **Artifact-first rule:** Before doing work, create/verify the phase artifact:
   - intake → ticket at `.safeword-project/tickets/{id}-{slug}/ticket.md`
   - define-behavior → test-definitions at `.safeword-project/tickets/{id}-{slug}/test-definitions.md`
6. **Execute phase** using the appropriate phase file
7. **Update phase** in ticket when transitioning

## Phase Files

Load the appropriate file based on current phase:

| Phase             | File         |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| `intake`          | DISCOVERY.md |
| `define-behavior` | SCENARIOS.md |
| `scenario-gate`   | SCENARIOS.md |
| `implement`       | TDD.md       |
| `verify`          | VERIFY.md    |
| `done`            | DONE.md      |

## Key Takeaways

- **patch/task** → TDD directly (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
- **feature** → full BDD flow, track in ticket `phase:` field
- **Resume** → read ticket, find first unchecked scenario, continue
- **Split** → check thresholds at Entry, define-behavior, scenario-gate; user decides (see SPLITTING.md)
- **Verify gate** → run /verify + /audit, writes verify.md. Stop hook blocks done without it.
- **Done** → close ticket (trivial — verify.md must already exist)
- When unsure → default to task, user can `/bdd` to override
