# Verify

Prove a ticket meets its criteria. Works with or without an active ticket.

## Invocation log

This skill is required at the done-gate (ticket 147). The line below appends a session-scoped entry to `.safeword-project/skill-invocations.log` so the done-gate hook can verify /verify was actually invoked. Bash injection runs at render time — hand-writing verify.md cannot produce this entry.

!`PROJECT_DIR="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)}" && mkdir -p "$PROJECT_DIR/.safeword-project" && echo "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ) ${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID} verify" >> "$PROJECT_DIR/.safeword-project/skill-invocations.log" && echo "[skill-invocation-log] verify ✓" || echo "[skill-invocation-log] FAILED — done-gate will block"`

**If you see `[skill-invocation-log] FAILED` above, or no `verify ✓` line at all**: STOP. Do not run /verify manually — that line is the only proof the done-gate accepts. Report the failure to the user (most likely cause: Claude Code's bash permission denied the injection) and ask them to resolve it before re-invoking /verify.

## Instructions

### 1. Find Current Ticket (if any)

```bash
# Find in_progress tickets, excluding epics
for f in .safeword-project/tickets/*/ticket.md; do
  [ -f "$f" ] || continue
  grep -q "^status: in_progress" "$f" && ! grep -q "^type: epic" "$f" && echo "$f"
done | head -1
```

If a ticket is found, read it to get:

- `parent:` field (if any)
- Ticket ID/slug for test-definitions lookup

If no ticket is found, skip scenario validation (step 3) and parent check (step 4).

### 2. Run Automated Checks

Run these in sequence, reporting each result:

1. **Run `/lint`** to auto-fix style issues first
2. Then run verification:

```bash
# Full test suite
bun run test 2>&1

# Build check
bun run build 2>&1
```

The `/lint` command handles linting with auto-fix. Report any remaining unfixable errors.

### 3. Validate Test Definitions (skip if no ticket)

1. Find matching file: `.safeword-project/tickets/{id}-{slug}/test-definitions.md`
2. Count scenarios: total `- [` lines
3. Count completed: `- [x]` lines
4. Report: "Scenarios: X/Y complete"

If any unchecked `[ ]` remain, list them.

### 4. Check Parent Epic (skip if no ticket)

If ticket has `parent:` field:

1. Read parent ticket
2. Get `children:` array
3. Check each child's `status:`
4. Report: "Siblings: X/Y done"

### 5. Check Dependency Drift

Compare `package.json` dependencies against `ARCHITECTURE.md`:

1. If `ARCHITECTURE.md` does not exist, skip this check
2. Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` content
3. Read `package.json` `dependencies` and `devDependencies` keys
4. For each dependency name:
   - Extract the package name (without `@scope/` prefix for matching — but check both full name and short name)
   - Check if `ARCHITECTURE.md` mentions the package name (case-insensitive)
5. Flag any dependency NOT mentioned: `"Dependency \`{name}\` not documented in ARCHITECTURE.md"`

Do NOT flag:

- `@types/*` packages (type-only, not architectural)
- Packages in `devDependencies` that are tooling (eslint plugins, prettier plugins, test utils) — only flag deps that represent architectural choices

### 6. Report Results

Structure the report in three sections, in this order. **Empty sections are hidden entirely** — no "None" placeholders, no empty headers.

#### Status (the existing Verify Checklist — facts only)

The Status section uses the existing Verify Checklist format. Format with these EXACT patterns (the done-gate hook validates them):

```
## Verify Checklist

**Test Suite:** ✓ X/X tests pass (or ❌ N failures)
**Build:** ✅ Success (or ❌ Failed)
**Lint:** ✅ Clean (or ❌ N errors)
**Scenarios:** All N scenarios marked complete (or ❌ X/Y complete, or ⏭️ Skipped — no ticket)
**Dep Drift:** ✅ Clean (or ⚠️ N undocumented deps, or ⏭️ Skipped — no ARCHITECTURE.md)
**Parent Epic:** {id} (siblings: X/Y done) or N/A
**Reconcile:** ✅ No pattern deviation (or ⚠️ N deviations, M missing uplevel ticket — soft, never blocks)
```

**Reconcile** is soft — it never blocks the done gate. If the work introduced a pattern that diverges from existing siblings (see `.safeword/guides/architecture-guide.md` → Survey & Reconcile), confirm the ticket carries a reconcile record and every deviation has an uplevel follow-up ticket; flag any that don't. Use `N/A` when the work conformed or introduced no new pattern.

**Done-gate evidence patterns** (the stop hook validates these literal phrases — do not move or rename):

- `✓ X/X tests pass` — proves test suite ran
- `All N scenarios marked complete` — proves scenarios checked
- `Audit passed` — proves /audit ran (run /audit separately)

Without all three patterns in Status, the done phase will hard block.

#### Decisions needed (spec / scope / value)

Only include this section when there are spec, scope, or value questions the USER must answer.

**Implementation-path questions (which approach, which pattern, which library) do NOT go here — they belong in "Agent's next actions" because the agent owns implementation choices.**

Borderline classification examples:

- "Should we use NextAuth or Lucia for auth?" → implementation-path → goes in **Actions** (agent picks one with reasoning, user can override).
- "Should this endpoint be at /v1/projects or /v2/projects?" → value decision (API contract) → goes in **Decisions**.
- "Is R5.x in scope for this slice or punt to slice 4?" → scope decision → goes in **Decisions**.
- "Should we extract this helper or inline it?" → implementation-path → goes in **Actions**.
- "Is 4xx the right HTTP status for this error?" → spec decision (if the spec exists, look it up; otherwise it's a value call) → goes in **Decisions**.

**Hard cap of 5 items** per section. If more exist, list the top 5 (most load-bearing) and add:

> - N others, see test-definitions.md

**Decisions section is hidden when empty** — no "None" placeholder. Do not surface the section at all if zero decisions exist.

#### Agent's next actions

Only include this section when there are concrete forward actions the agent will take. Each action must be **concrete and falsifiable** — not vague exploration ("look into X"), but a specific verb + object the agent will execute ("add integration test for R7.3 covering 404-on-uncovered-PATCH").

**Hard cap of 5 items** per section. If more exist, list the top 5 and add:

> - N others, see test-definitions.md

**Actions section is hidden when empty** — no "None" placeholder.

#### All-green collapse

When **all Status checks pass AND zero decisions AND zero actions**, collapse the entire report to a single-line verdict:

> Ready to mark done.

No sections, no ceremony. Single line.

## Summary

This command verifies ticket criteria (the done gate). Use it before marking any feature ticket complete. It also works without a ticket for quick project health checks (tests + build + lint + dep drift).
