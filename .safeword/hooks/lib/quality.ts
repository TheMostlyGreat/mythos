// Shared quality review message for Claude Code and Cursor hooks.
// Used by: stop-quality.ts, cursor/stop.ts
//
// Contract: every Stop terminates in CONFIDENT or BLOCKED (binary terminal).
// CONFIDENT carries a decision brief — Decided / Rejected (optional) / Open /
// Next. BLOCKED carries Tried / Need so escalation is a clean handoff. Per-phase
// evidence templates make CONFIDENT falsifiable with phase-specific criteria.
//
// Rendering: model output renders as GFM/CommonMark in Claude Code. Single
// newlines collapse to spaces (soft-break); blank lines start new paragraphs.
// Bold-led sub-fields separated by blank lines render as a scannable stacked
// column. Indent inside a paragraph is a no-op.
//
// Style discipline: this prompt is reinjected every Stop. Keep it terse and
// load-bearing. Project philosophy (research-depth, critical-review,
// investigate-on-uncertainty) lives in SAFEWORD.md which loads every
// conversation — don't duplicate it here.
//
// Calibration grounding: Kadavath 2022, Lin 2022, Tian 2023 — tokenized
// verdicts beat free-form uncertainty descriptions for calibration.

const UNIVERSAL_HEADER = `Apply SAFEWORD.md "Talking to the user" rules to your reply: scan-not-read, lead with the answer, named structure only when it carries weight, end with **Next:**.

End with one verdict as its own scannable decision brief — the reader is choosing whether to continue, redirect, or intervene with this block as their only context. Plain English; no jargon the reader hasn't seen this turn. Reproduce the shape below exactly: bolded labels, blank line between each paragraph.

Implementation choices are yours. BLOCKED is for spec/scope/value decisions that need human input. Multiple unknowns: resolve the small ones, BLOCK on the largest.

**CONFIDENT** — <one-line plain-English claim>.

**Decided:** <1-2 sentences naming the actual choice and what changes>.

**Rejected:** <alt — one-line reason>; <alt — one-line reason>. (Omit this paragraph entirely if no real alternatives were considered.)

**Open:** <resolved this turn | deferred to <ticket-or-follow-up> | none>.

**Next:** <one concrete imperative — what you'll do or recommend>.

**BLOCKED** — <one specific unknown (a question with a falsifiable answer)>.

**Tried:** <concrete verb + object>.

**Need:** <unblock>. (Optional: propose one parallel action if non-blocker work exists.)
